# Tonotopy

It contains the analytical code to understand the developmental mechanisms of mouse cochlear duct using scRNA-seq datasets from E12.5 and E14.5 two time points. 

# Abstract

# Analytical Pipelines
Here we include analytical pipeline code for our manuscript.
* Seurat v3 pipeline: Seurat v3 pipeline is to analyze scRNA-seq datasets from both E12.5 and E14.5 time points. We considered E12.5 and E14.5 datasets separately. For each dataset, we conducted QC steps, identified clusters, annotated cell type for each cluster using marker genes, and determined differentially expressed genes for each cell type. We followed the documentations from https://satijalab.org/seurat/
